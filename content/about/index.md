You've reached my website! I hope you'll find it cozy and a nice place to stay.
My name is Ariadna, and you may know me from past projects here and there in the
FOSS world. After a long hiatus, I'm back!

This website is meant to be a place where I share my journey back into the FOSS
world, coding, commenting the latest news around FOSS, and the occasional
personal or philosophical post.
