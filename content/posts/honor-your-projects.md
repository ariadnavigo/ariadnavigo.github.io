I'm writing this while I'm pondering whether [a project of mine][lc] is ready
for its first release, 0.1. I don't like to rush things out, even though I do
believe in _Release early, release often,_ so I've been thinking about whether
it is time or not... and that led me to a different train of thought I wanted to
share with you, especially people out there who, like me, are amateurs with
little experience and who only write small projects.

There are _impressive_ projects out there. Not just the famous ones. There are
amazing programmers out there doing stuff you (and I) watch in awe, thinking
we're never going to pull something like that out. There are developers out
there who code in unexpected languages, others who have contributed huge
platforms for others to use, others who have deep knowledge about low level
quirks or algorithms... and at least to me, I've felt disheartened more than
once, feeling like a fraud and feeling that your projects don't deserve any
attention or shouldn't be published. I've felt ridiculous after comparing myself
to programmers whose work I've admired.

I wanted to tell you that the feeling is understandable, but remember your path
is yours. Your motivations for programming are yours as well. I'm not a
professional programmer and probably won't ever be, so I'm just trying to have
fun and coding has a meditative property to it for me that calms me down and
helps me focus. Your reasons and what you feel when programming is entirely
yours and probably different. Maybe you do want a career, maybe circumstances
threw you into it, who knows.

However, _honor your projects,_ no matter how big or small. They're a part of
you. If you publish them on a public repo, do it with pride: you wrote that. It
might not be the next Linux for the rest of the world, but please look at it as
an important part of _your_ journey. Keep those projects tidy, though. Even if 
it's a simple shell script, please fix the bugs, keep the documentation updated,
or archive the project if you don't feel maintaining it anymore. Treat your
projects with care, love, and seriousness: you never know if someday someone
might approach you to package that simple project because they liked it.

Every line of code you write, every commit, every stupid bug you introduced and
later fixed, everything makes up your story. We are not static creatures, we're
made of our journeys. You are a programmer if you write programs and have
respect for the craft.

Remember: that little program you wrote 5 years ago paved the way to what you
are, do, and know today. Don't make the mistake I made some time ago of deleting
everything I coded, in shame, because of a very bad case of internalized
mysogyny and imposter syndrome. I regret it a lot. Every repository you've
worked on is a child of your creativity, which ultimately is our strongest power
as humans.
