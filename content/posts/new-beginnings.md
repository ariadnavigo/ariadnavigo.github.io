So, this is my _n-th_ attempt in writing a blog. Over the years I've been all
over the place: I had a long streak blogging about FOSS-related topics, then I
switched to more personal matters, bouncing from English to Spanish multiple
times, and also trying my hand in more philosophical topics. Also, I had my ups
and downs as an amateur programmer over the years, but some (two?) years ago I
made the mistake of quitting everything related to development, even deleting
all my repositories, because...

OK, the motives behind that are rather personal and I feel quite dumb in
retrospect. I'm not getting into the details of the past, but I do want to give
some hints about what my future plans.

I've been working on some code lately. Apart from some shell scripts, I haven't
published any of it yet, because it's all way too green right now. These
programs may never see the light, or maybe they will. In general, I'd like to
avoid rewriting from memory old stuff I had worked in the past, except one for 
thing: a readline-like line editing library for terminal-based programs. I 
wrote one years ago and I don't have any of that code at hand, but I do want to
tackle the problem again, this time getting Unicode right from the start
(_libicu?_).

I also want to write in other languages besides C and POSIX shell. I've always
felt attracted to Go, and having a taste of Rust as well. Let's say I want to
know more about these new systems programming languages that are advertised as
the replacement for old and venerable C. Python is a language I have worked
with, but for which I may need some refresher and updating.

On the other hand, after many years not doing so, I have been following (some)
FOSS news lately, and I miss writing commentary on what's going on in our small,
little world of Free Software.

So this is it: I'm _back._ If you missed me, your beautiful Ariadna, these last
couple of years, I hope you'll find this new beginning something to look forward
to as eagerly as I do.
